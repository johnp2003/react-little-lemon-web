# Little Lemon Booking Website (REACT)

## Project Description
During my journey in Meta's Coursera Front-End Development course, I had the opportunity to create a website that truly showcases my progress in the program. This website features a booking application integrated into the Little Lemon Website, which I built using React components to create the site and making API calls. 

Please note: the only functionality working on this website besides the design is the "Reserve a Table" function.

## Screenshots
Here are some screeenshots of the application.
